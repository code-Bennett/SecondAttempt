                Welcome! My name is Josh, I’m hailing from Bristol with a keen interest in tech & design. Other interests include photography, basketball, and music (but who doesn’t love music). I’ve always been a fan of new technology and that’s mainly down to wanting a new video game console every time one was released. I've recently discovered how creative you can be with writing code and have found it quite satisfying to be able to solve issues and structure full blown web pages. Having a strong interest in design I was intrigued and decided on creating my own. This will be my first attempt. Enjoy!
